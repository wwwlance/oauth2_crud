Hi

Steps:

Clone the repo
Configure your .env file with the corresponding DB details
Run migration

Note: 

To access the CRUD for customers, you need to register and login first.

to register, go to /register. after that, login using your credentials.

go to /customers to access the CRUD

runing the unit test seem to fail but the crud works on UI and apis are being consumed correctly
